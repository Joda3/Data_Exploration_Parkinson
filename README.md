# Data_Exploration_Parkinson
 
The objective of this work is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can classify whether a person has Idiopathic Parkinson Syndrome using speech samples. In this way, the diagnosis of Parkinson's should be simplified, since early and unambiguous classification is often very difficult and ambiguous.

How to run the code:
1. pull the code from the repository 
2. download the dataset "parkinsons.data" from this website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/
3. In line 19: update the local path for the dataset 
4. to run the code you will need the following modules: pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, optuna
5. make sure those are properly installed and run the code
6. warning: there are about 26 different plots ploted, if you dont want to see them just put an "#" in line 146
